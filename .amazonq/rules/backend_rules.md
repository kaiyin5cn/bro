### **Project Flow Overview (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Stack)**

This document outlines the design and implementation of a URL shortener system using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It's structured to guide an agentic assistant (like Claude) through phased development, starting with a Proof of Concept and progressively scaling the architecture.

*   **Target Stack:** Node.js for backend logic, Express.js for the web framework, and MongoDB as the primary database.
*   **Core Principles:** API endpoints for shortening and redirection, base62 encoding for short URLs, and a robust data model.
*   **Phases:** Begin with a minimal functional PoC, then scale by introducing solutions like load balancing (NGINX/PM2), asynchronous processing with message queues, caching (Redis), and distributed components.
*   **Assumptions:** MongoDB for data storage; base62 hashing of sequential IDs; unique ID generation via a custom counter in MongoDB.
*   **Flow Format:** Structured as phased Markdown, describing the implementation steps and components.

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Minimal Functional Components)**

**Goal:** Validate the core functionalities (shorten URL, redirect) on a single process/server. This phase uses a lightweight setup for MongoDB.

**Flow Process:**

1.  **Set up basic app structure:**
    *   Initialize a Node.js project.
    *   Install necessary packages: `express` for the web server, `mongoose` for MongoDB Object Data Modeling (ODM), `dotenv` for environment variables. A utility for base62 encoding will also be needed.
    *   Establish a connection to a local MongoDB instance.
2.  **Implement Data Model:**
    *   Define a Mongoose schema for `URL` entries. This schema will include fields for a numerical `_id` (which will correspond to the sequential ID for base62 encoding), the `longURL`, and the generated `shortURL`.
    *   Implement a separate Mongoose model for a `Counter`. This `Counter` model will be used to generate unique, sequential integer IDs, mimicking the auto-increment behavior found in relational databases. A function will be created to atomically increment this counter and return the next available ID.
3.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   **`POST /shorten`:** This endpoint will receive a `longURL` in the request body. It will first check if the `longURL` already exists in the database. If it does, the existing `shortURL` will be returned. If not, it will obtain a new sequential ID from the `Counter` model, convert this ID into a base62 encoded string to serve as the `shortURL`, save both the `longURL` and `shortURL` (along with the sequential ID) to the MongoDB `URL` collection, and then return the generated `shortURL` in the response.
    *   **`GET /:shortURL`:** This endpoint will receive a `shortURL` as a path parameter. It will query the MongoDB `URL` collection to find the corresponding `longURL`. If found, it will perform an HTTP 301 (Permanent) redirect to the `longURL`. If not found, it will return a 404 "Not Found" response.
4.  **Hashing:** The `shortURL` will be generated by performing a base62 conversion on the unique sequential integer ID obtained from the `Counter` collection. A utility function will handle this encoding.
5.  **Test:** The application will be run locally using Node.js. A test will involve sending a request to shorten a URL and then navigating to the generated short URL to verify that it correctly redirects to the original long URL.

**Validation:** This setup demonstrates the fundamental shortening and redirection capabilities. It's suitable for very low traffic, serving as a foundational proof of concept.

### **Phase 2: Basic Scaling (Load Balancing & Process Management)**

**Goal:** Handle moderate traffic (e.g., 100 requests per second) by incorporating process management and caching.

**Flow Process:**

1.  **Database:** MongoDB remains the primary database. For this phase, the existing Mongoose setup will continue to be used. For production, the MongoDB instance should be configured as a replica set for high availability.
2.  **Cluster Application:** PM2 (Process Manager 2) will be used to run multiple instances of the Node.js application. This allows the application to leverage multiple CPU cores on the server, significantly increasing its processing capacity. PM2 will be configured to start the maximum number of instances based on available CPU cores.
3.  **Add Load Balancer:** NGINX will be deployed as a reverse proxy and load balancer in front of the Node.js application. NGINX will listen for incoming HTTP requests and distribute them across the different Node.js instances managed by PM2. This ensures efficient request handling and prevents any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.
4.  **Caching:** Redis will be introduced as an in-memory cache. For read-heavy operations like URL redirection, the application will first attempt to retrieve the `longURL` from Redis using the `shortURL` as the key.
    *   When a URL is shortened and saved to MongoDB, its `shortURL` and `longURL` mapping will also be stored in Redis.
    *   When a redirect request comes in, the application will check Redis first. If the mapping is found in Redis, the redirect will occur directly from the cache, significantly reducing database lookups. If not found in Redis, the application will query MongoDB, and upon retrieving the `longURL`, it will store this mapping in Redis for future requests.

**Benefits:** This phase significantly improves the application's throughput and responsiveness. Load balancing distributes the workload, and caching drastically reduces the load on the MongoDB database for frequent redirect requests, enabling the system to handle around 1,000 requests per second.

### **Phase 3: Microservices for Latency & Write Optimization**

**Goal:** Address potential write latency and scale the system to handle higher loads (e.g., 10,000+ requests per second) by decoupling functionalities into independent microservices.

**Flow Process:**

1.  **Split into Microservices:** The monolithic application will be broken down into three distinct services:
    *   **Shortening Service:** This service will be responsible solely for handling `POST /shorten` requests. Its primary function will be to receive `longURL`s and publish them to a message queue.
    *   **Worker Service:** This service will consume messages from the message queue. For each message (containing a `longURL`), it will generate a unique ID, perform base62 encoding to create the `shortURL`, save the mapping to MongoDB, and then cache the mapping in Redis. This service can be scaled independently to handle varying loads of URL shortening tasks.
    *   **Redirect Service:** This service will handle all `GET /:shortURL` requests. It will prioritize fetching the `longURL` from the Redis cache. If not found in Redis, it will query MongoDB and then cache the result before performing the redirect.
2.  **Async Writes:** A message queue system (like RabbitMQ) will be introduced. When the Shortening Service receives a request, instead of directly interacting with the database, it will publish the `longURL` to a designated queue. This makes the `shorten` API call very fast, as it doesn't wait for the database operation to complete. The Worker Service will then asynchronously pick up these tasks from the queue and process them in the background.
3.  **Service Discovery:** For inter-service communication (e.g., if the Worker Service needs to call an ID generation service), simple environment variables or a more sophisticated service discovery mechanism (like Consul) can be used to locate services.
4.  **Starting Servers:** Each microservice will be managed and run using PM2 or a similar process manager. Each service can have its own `app.js` file and be started independently.
5.  **Scaling:** The independent nature of microservices allows for granular scaling. For example, if the rate of URL shortening requests increases, more instances of the Worker Service can be deployed without affecting the Redirect Service's performance. Similarly, the Redirect Service can be scaled based on read traffic.
6.  **NGINX Routing:** NGINX will be configured to route requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request path (e.g., `/shorten` requests go to the Shortening Service, and all other paths go to the Redirect Service).

**Benefits:** This microservices architecture significantly reduces write latency for the user, as the API call returns quickly. It also allows for independent scaling of different parts of the system, making it highly adaptable to varying workloads and aligning with the article's scalability requirements.

### **Phase 4: Full Production Scaling**

**Goal:** Achieve the highest levels of scale, high availability, and fault tolerance to handle the article's estimated traffic (11,000 reads/sec, 1,000 writes/sec) and beyond.

**Flow Process:**

1.  **Distributed Database:**
    *   **MongoDB Sharding:** For horizontal scaling of the `URL` collection, MongoDB sharding will be implemented. This distributes data across multiple independent MongoDB clusters (shards), allowing the system to handle massive amounts of data and concurrent operations.
    *   **Replica Sets:** All MongoDB instances, including those within shards, will be configured as replica sets. This provides data redundancy and automatic failover, ensuring high availability even if a database server fails.
2.  **Advanced ID Generation:** A dedicated Node.js microservice will be created solely for generating unique, sequential IDs. This service can implement a robust distributed ID generation algorithm (like a custom counter with strong consistency guarantees or a Snowflake-inspired approach) to ensure high throughput and collision-free ID assignment across all worker instances. The Worker Service will call this ID generator service to obtain IDs before creating short URLs.
3.  **Orchestration:** A cluster orchestrator such as HashiCorp Nomad or Kubernetes will be used. This tool will automate the deployment, scaling, healing, and management of all microservices (Shortening, Worker, Redirect, ID Generator) across a cluster of physical or virtual machines. It ensures that services are always running, scaled appropriately, and can recover automatically from failures.
4.  **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring will be established using Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus will collect metrics (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency, resource utilization) from all Node.js applications, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and the underlying infrastructure. Grafana will provide interactive dashboards for visualizing these metrics, enabling proactive identification of performance bottlenecks and rapid response to issues.
5.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   **Collision Handling:** While sequential ID generation minimizes collisions, robust mechanisms will be in place for rare scenarios, potentially involving retries or a fallback to a different ID generation strategy if a collision is detected.
    *   **Analytics:** For detailed analytics on URL usage, redirect events can be logged to a separate, scalable data pipeline (e.g., streaming to Kafka for processing by an analytics engine) rather than relying solely on HTTP 302 redirects.
6.  **Deployment:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Ansible or Terraform will be used to automate the entire deployment process. This includes provisioning servers, configuring network settings, installing software dependencies, and deploying all microservices across multiple hosts in a consistent and repeatable manner.

**Validation:** At this stage, the system will undergo rigorous stress testing to simulate 10-year projected traffic. Validation will focus on ensuring the system's ability to handle peak loads, maintain low latency, and demonstrate high availability and fault tolerance in the face of component failures.
